TeWA prediction: Statistical forecasting of subseasonal anomalies by using teleconnections and Wavelet-ARIMA

This repository contains material to support an application example of subseasonal forecasting:
- Data: 
  * Time series of teleconnections indices, selected as predictors.
  * Time series of the (past) observed variable, the target to predict.
  * Time series of the (future) observed variable, to validate the prediction.
- R code:
  * List of TeWA functions
  * Example to apply the functions by using the above data.
